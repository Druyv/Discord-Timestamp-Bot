# Discord-Timestamp-Bot

Discord has these very useful Unix timestamps, but generating can be a bit of a pain. You'd have to go somewhere to calculate the Unix timestamp, look up what formatting you want and then build the timestamp. But no longer, because this bot can do it for you! 

Simply feed it a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM]) and augment it with your timezone (like PST+3, or UTC-2) if necessary, and the bot gives you a handy dandy overview of copy/pastable configurations for your timestamps, ready to paste into Discord :)
